MobileAppsDev2 Game 

My App is called Workforce Clicker. It is designed to play in the style of many 'Clicker' games such as Cookier Clicker and Clicker Heroes.

The aim of the game is to select a difficulty setting of your choosing. This is to determine how hard or easy it would be to reach the games end goal. 

The end goal is every mode is simple; Reach the amount of money that is set by the end of the designated term(One Year is this version). 
You must click the blue bar to earn money on a daily basis.

Then with the money earned, you must hire other workers who will help with other jobs and projects to further earn even more money.

Combine this with the help of a complete of useful, but expensive perks, reaching the goal shouldn't be too difficult... hopefully! 

Good Luck out there, it'll be a tough year!
